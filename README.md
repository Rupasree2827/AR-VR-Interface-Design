DESCRIPTION :
AR Furniture Placement - User Interface Design

This project presents a user interface (UI) design for an Augmented Reality (AR) application focused on virtual furniture placement. The application allows users to visualize and interact with 3D furniture models in their real environment using intuitive controls such as tap, rotate, scale, and voice commands. The design prioritizes minimalism, clarity, and user-friendly interactions to ensure a seamless AR experience. This task was completed as part of an AR/VR Interface Design assignment and showcases the essential screens required to initiate and interact within the AR environment.
he mockups were created to reflect a practical and modern design approach using spatial UI concepts and clean layouts suitable for AR/VR applications.
